%The resulting nonuniform drift field introduced a second source of position dependent signal variations.  During a recoil event, ionizing radiation produces both ionization and excitation of the xenon atoms.  The xenon excimers (Xe$_2^*$) produce scintillation light as they return to the ground state, which we observe as our S1 signal. Some of the electrons produced during ionization escape the location of the event, drift to the top of our detector, and produce our S2 signal.  The electrons that do not escape the event recombine with the ionized xenon atoms in a process called recombination, producing additional xenon excimers that contribute to the S1 signal.  Recoil events which occur in a lower field region of the detector have a higher chance to recombine, and therefore produce more S1 signal and less S2 signal than an equivalent event in a high field region.  The strength of this effect is dependent on the energy of the event and whether the event is an electron recoil (ER) or a nuclear recoil (NR) (Figure \ref{fig:LYQY}).  Note that these energy and recoil-dependent signal variations will be referred to as "field effects" in this paper.  




The decay properties of $^{83m}$Kr events are described in detail in Ref.~\cite{scottspaper}. Here we note 
that the decay proceeds as two mono-energetic electromagnetic depositions with energies of 
32.1~keV and 9.4~keV. The half-life of the intermediate metastable state is 154~ns. In a two-phase LXe
TPC such as LUX, the S1 signals of the two decays can be distinguished
in most events because the ~nanosecond timing resolution of the PMTs 
is much faster than the half-life of the intermediate state.  We refer
to the two S1 signals as S1a (32.1~keV) and S1b (9.4~keV). 
The charge signals of the two decays, however, are indistinguishable, being integrated
by the microsecond collection time of the detector anode. 
These facts are illustrated for two representative $^{83m}$Kr events 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:Sumpod}. 


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/Fig2.png}
\captionof{figure}{S2 (upper) and S1 (lower) PMT waveforms from a typical $^{83m}$Kr decay, normalized to one. Two events with differing decay times are shown. Note the distinct time scales on the S2 and S1 plot axes. The 32.1~keV and 9.4~keV decays are distinct in S1, but are summed together in S2 due to the $\sim$microsecond collection time of the S2 anode region. Although the S2 signals are required to follow the S1 signals in time, for clarity the S2 signals are shown here centered on $t=0$.}
 \label{fig:Sumpod}
\end{figure}


The average S1a and S1b pulse areas vary in space and time owing to the imperfect light collection
efficiency of the detector, however the event-by-event ratio
S1a/S1b is insensitive to such variations because correlated decays from the same $^{83m}$Kr 
parent atom occur at the same location and at virtually the same time. 
These statements remain approximately true 
when historgramming S1a and S1b measurements separately 
in a small volume element (voxel) of the active detector over several hours of $^{83m}$Kr data
and taking the ratio of histogram averages.
Since the two decays are mono-energetic
and of a uniform type (both electromagnetic), both the event-by-event S1a/S1b 
and its voxel-averaged counterpart depend only on 
the local electric field and the detector resolution for S1 scintillation. 
Higher fields act to suppress the lights yields of both decays, but the suppression is stronger
for the 32.1~keV S1a decay, resulting in an inverse relationship between the true local 
electric field and the S1a/S1b ratio. 

We have determined the correspondence between S1a/S1b and the true electric
field with LUX data.
We select $^{83m}$Kr events from the September 2015 LUX calibration campaign
with exactly one S2 between 2000 to 60000~phd, and one or more S1 candidates 
greater than 10~phd occurring before the S2. We fit a double exponential to the S1 candidates and 
extract their pulse area and the time between decays. To ensure a good measurement of the 
S1a and S1b pulse areas, we require the time difference to be greater than 130~ns. 
We fit Gaussians to the S1a and S1b histograms in each voxel and take the ratio of the fitted means. 
We query the September 2015 COMSOL field model described in 
Ref.~\cite{luciespaper} to determine the 
true electric field of each voxel for each $^{83m}$Kr dataset. 
A scatter plot of the electric field vs S1a/S1b in each detector voxel for September 2015 
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:s1as1bvsfield}, for field values between XXX and YYY V/cm. 
The same functional form is  observed in other $^{83m}$Kr datasets 
collected throughout Run 4 under 
varying detector electric field conditions. We fit a function to the September 2015 data as 
shown in the Figure and find XXXXX.

Once the field smoothing functions are known, 
knowledge of the absolute electric field is not needed to apply them
to LUX $^{83m}$Kr calibration data, nor for applying detector corrections
to WIMP search data. In fact, as will be shown in Sec.~\ref{sec:corrections}, 
we characterize field-smoothing directly as a function of
S1a/S1b, as a proxy for electric field, 
and we apply detector efficiency corrections as functions of the event drift time. 
Knowledge of the true electric field is useful for other purposes, however,
such as when comparing LUX data to light and charge yield expectations from the NEST framework, 
and when comparing to other experiments, which may operate at a different electric field value. 
It is worth noting that any LXe detector with $^{83m}$Kr calibration data and sufficient
timing to separate S1a and S1b should be able to make use of Fig.~\ref{fig:s1as1b-electric-field}
to infer its true electric field \emph{in situ}, since the relationship depends only on the 
fundamental light yields of LXe at 32.1 and 9.4~keV.

\section{Measurement of the $^{83m}$Kr field-smoothing functions}
\label{section:GenStrat}

In this section we describe how the $^{83m}$Kr field-smoothing functions are derived from LUX calibration data.

Because it was injected twice per week, producing $10^5$ to $10^6$ of events per injection, the LUX $^{83m}$Kr calibration data is 
by far the richest dataset in the LUX catalog for tracking detector performance and behavior over time. In addition to these frequent calibrations, 
LUX also carried out periodic calibration campaigns with a suite of complementary calibration sources. These campaigns made use itritium, 
$^{137}$Cs, and neutron sources, in addition to large $^{83m}$Kr injections. Four such campaigns were carried out during Run 4: in XXX 2014, 
XXX 2015, XXX 2015, and XXX 2016. In this section we derive the field-smoothing functions making use of the September 2015 
calibration campaign data. This campaign produced large statistics for both $^{83m}$Kr and tritium, and occurred roughly in the middle of WS2014-16.

For clarity we begin by showing the S1 and S2 field smoothing functions in Fig.~\ref{fig:AllMeasurements} and describing 
their use. To field smooth a particular $^{83m}$Kr calibration dataset, the $^{83m}$Kr S1 and S2 signals in each detector $z$-slice
are divided by the scale factors shown in the figure, based upon the S1a/S1b 
ratio observed locally in that slice. The two functions have opposite slopes because increasing the electric field has 
opposite effects on charge and scintillation yields. (In the figure, increasing S1a/S1b corresponds to decreasing electric field.)
The functions cross with a value of unity for an S1a/S1b of XXXX, which corresponds to our standard field value of XXX V/cm. 
This field was obtained in the center of LUX during the September 2015 campaign. Although the two functions display
the well known anti-correlation of light and charge yields in LXe as a function of field, they are not multiplicative inverses of each other
numerically because the average electron recoil yields are not equivalent at 41.5~keV and XXX V/cm. 

Note that although the field smoothing functions are measured with September 2015 LUX data, they are applicable
to $^{83m}$Kr data in any LXe TPC over the range of electric fields probed by LUX. In particular, they apply equally well to the 
remaining LUX $^{83m}$Kr calibration data, data that was not used in their derivation.

\subsection{Measurement of the S2 field smoothing function using tritium data}

We first derive the S2 field smoothing function from the September 2015 calibration campaign data,
making use of contemporaneous tritium data to derive S2 detector efficiency corrections 
for this time period. Tritium's advantage over $^{83m}$Kr is that the field dependence of its light and charge 
yield is already well-modeled by NEST, due to the measurements reported in Ref.~\cite{tritium}.
We query the COMSOL field model for September 2015 in each detector voxel, and we use the NEST description of
charge and light yields as a function of electric field to field-smooth this tritium dataset.
Because the electric field dependence of the tritium yields is very modest (owing to the low energy of these events 
and low recombination), field-smoothing has only a small
effect on the tritium data. In this respect tritium is superior to $^{83m}$Kr as a detector monitoring calibration source. 
As a beta decay source, tritium does not provide a narrow line that can act as an ideal recognizable 
feature for extracting corrections, but its broad maximum at XXX~keV, 
is sufficient for our narrow and modest purpose. 

After NEST-guided field-smoothing is applied to the September 2015 tritium data, the S2 correction
is extracted as a function of $z$ and applied to the $^{83m}$Kr data from the same time period, leaving
only field effects in the $^{83m}$Kr data. The 
S2-corrected $^83m$Kr data is then subdivided into voxels, and the ratio of the average 
S2 signal in each voxel to that at the center of the detector is plotted versus the S1a/S1b. In total XXX
voxels are employed to define the S2 field-smoothing function. The quadratic fit function is 

 \begin{multline}
\frac{S2_{E,Kr}(xyz)}{S2_{E,Kr}(center)} =   \\ -0.499 \left(\frac{S1a}{S1b} \right)^2 + 1.48  \left(\frac{S1a}{S1b} \right) + 0.667
\end{multline}

\noindent
and it is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:AllMeasurements}.

\subsection{Measurement of the S1 field smoothing function using tritium data}



Because of the high light yield of electron recoil events in LXe at energies below 3 keV, there is no discernable peak in tritium S1 
data that can be used to measure an S1 light collection efficiency function. 
This prevents us from directly measuring the S1 field-smoothing function in the same manner as that of 
the S2 as described above. 

Instead, we employ a simultaneous fit to tritium and  $^{83m}$Kr data, demanding that the reconstructed energy of 
dataset match the expected distribution and be independent of field. We


Instead, three approaches have been taken to measure the relationship of the field effect in inefficiency corrected $^{83m}$Kr S1 data, as measured by S1(XYZ)/S1(Center), to the $^{83m}$Kr S1a/S1b ratio.  The first approach, in section \ref{section:S1relation}, converts the S2 field effect relationship to an S1 field effect relationship using the physics behind recombination.  In section \ref{MatthewsIdea} we use the expected light yield of the $^{83m}$Kr 31.2 keV decay as a function of electric field to measure detector inefficiency effects and separate them from the field effect we want to measure.  The final approach, in section \ref{section:S1relation2}, takes advantage of the fact that the energy spectrum of any event should remain insensitive to any recombination variation that arises from a non-uniform electric field.  In this method, we float the $^{83m}$Kr S1(XYZ)/S1(Center) to S1a/S1b relationship in a $\chi^2$ fit.  Within the fit we remove the field effect in both the S1 and S2 $^{83m}$Kr data (using the floated relationship for the S1 field effect), produce inefficiency-only corrections from the data, and then evaluate the corrected $^{83m}$Kr and CH$_3$T energy spectra.  The  S1(XYZ)/S1(Center) to S1a/S1b relationship which produces the minimum $\chi^2$ between the observed and expected energy spectra is chosen as the correct relationship.

Once the field induced S2(XYZ)/S2(Center) to S1a/S1b relationship and the field induced S1(XYZ)/S1(Center) to S1a/S1b relationship have been determined they can be used in $^{83m}$Kr data sets from any time to remove the field effects in the $^{83m}$Kr data via mapping the S1a/S1b ratio.  Once the field effects are removed the residual S1 and S2 variation in the $^{83m}$Kr can be used to calculate pulse area corrections based on detector inefficiencies alone. The following sections detail each step of the process outlined above.

\subsection{Measuring Detector Inefficiency Corrections with CH$_3$T}

The first step in measuring the strength of field effects in $^{83m}$Kr calibration data is to extract detector inefficiency corrections from contemporaneous CH$_3$T data.  We use data from the September 2015 CH$_3$T calibration due to its high statistics ($\sim$300,000 events). 

Before measuring detector inefficiency corrections from CH$_3$T, we must remove the field effects from the data.   The electric field at the location of each CH$_3$T event is estimated by interpolating the electric field map from~\cite{LuciesPaper}.  A cubic interpolation is used for events which fall within the bounds of the field map, and a nearest neighbor extrapolation is used for events which fall outside of the bounds.   

Once the field strength at the location of a particular event is determined it is converted to a measurement of the recombination for each event using the following equations from the NEST framework:
\begin{align}
N_q &= \frac{E}{0.0137} \label{NqEq} \\
N_{ion} &= \frac{N_q}{1+\alpha} \label{NionEq} \\
R &= 1-\mbox{ln} \left( \frac{1+(\frac{TI*N_{ion}}{4})}{(\frac{TI*N_{ion}}{4})} \right)
\end{align}
where $E$ is the energy of the event, $N_q$ is the number of quanta, $N_{ion}$ is the number of ions, $\alpha$ is the exciton to ion ratio (assumed to be 0.11), $TI$ is the Thomas-Imel Box parameter, and $R$ is the recombination probability.  Since we do not know the energy of the event ahead of time (since we do not have working corrections at this point) we assume the most probably energy from the CH$_3$T energy spectrum, which is 2.5 keV.  We are mainly interested in fitting the maximum of the spectrum when measuring detector inefficiency corrections, so the fact that this recombination estimate for higher energy CH$_3$T events may be wrong is not concerning.  

A normalization factor $N_{photon-center}/N_{photon}$ for the S1 signal is determined by calculating the number of photons produced in events at the center of the detector, and the number of photons produced in a particular event by using
\begin{equation}
N_{photon} = N_q\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha} + N_{ion}R
\end{equation}
Since we assumed a value of 2.5 keV for all events, the normalization constant only has a dependence on the estimated field strength at each location in the detector.  

Similarly, we determine a normalization factor $N_{elec-center}/N_{elec}$ for the S2 signal by calculating the number of electrons at the center of the detector and the number of electrons for a particular event by using the equation
\begin{equation}
N_{elec}=N_q-N_{photon}
\end{equation}
which again is only dependent on the estimated field strength at each location in the detector.  

We multiply the raw S1 and S2 signals by these normalization factors to remove the field effects from the CH$_3$T data.  For clarity, we define the field effect removed S1 and S2 signals as S1$_F$ and S2$_F$, respectively, where the subscript $F$ stands for "field corrected".   
\begin{align}
S2_F &=S2 \left( \frac{N_{elec-center}}{N_{elec}} \right) \\
S1_F &=S1 \left( \frac{N_{photon-center}}{N_{photon}} \right)
\end{align}
Likewise, we define the detector inefficiency corrected S1 and S2 signals (with field effects still present) as S1$_E$ and S2$_E$, where the subscript $E$ stands for "efficiency corrected."

After removing the field effects from the CH$_3$T data we are ready to measure the residual spatial pulse area variation due to detector inefficiencies alone.  We first measure the Z dependence of the S2$_F$ pulse area by slicing the detector into drift time bins of 10 $\mu$second width.  A Landau distribution is fit to the S2$_F$ spectrum of each bin to determine the location of the spectra maximums.  A cubic interpolation is used to determine the S2$_F$ Z dependence between each drift time bin, and a linear extrapolation based on the first and last 20\% of data points is used to determine the S2$_F$ Z dependence above and below the span of the drift time bins.  A detector inefficiency correction for the Z direction, defined as $\epsilon_{(S2,Z)}$, is measured by taking the ratio of the S2$_F$ pulse area at a height of 4 $\mu$seconds (just below the liquid surface) to the S2$_F$ pulse area as described in the equation
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{(S2,Z)}= \frac{S2_F(z=4)}{S2_F(z)}.
\end{equation} 


The XY dependence of the field removed S2$_F$ signal, defined as $\epsilon_{(S2,XY)}$, is found by dividing the Z inefficiency corrected (S2$_F \times \epsilon_{(S2,Z})$) data into two dimensional XY bins with lengths of 3 cm on each side, and then fitting Landau distributions to the data of each bin.  The maximum of the Landau distribution from each bin is used to construct an S2$_F$ XY dependence map, with a spline interpolation and extrapolation being used to determine the XY dependence between and outside of the bins.  A detector inefficiency correction for the XY direction is defined by taking the ratio of the z inefficiency corrected S2$_F$ pulse area at the center of the detector to the z inefficiency corrected S2$_F$ pulse area as a function of XY in cm, as shown below
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{(S2,XY)} = \frac{\epsilon_{(S2,Z)} \times S2_F(x_c,y_c,z)} { \epsilon_{(S2,Z)} \times S2_F(xyz)}.
\end{equation} 
where $x_c$ and $y_c$ are the x and y center of the detector in uncorrected coordinates determined by taking the average position of the CH$_3$T events in each direction.



Multiplying the raw S2 signal by both the Z and the XY correction factors results in an inefficiency corrected S2$_E$ signal (with field effects still present), 
\begin{equation}\label{E_eq}
S2_E =S2 \times \epsilon_{(S2,Z)} \times \epsilon_{(S2,XY)} 
\end{equation}

We are unable to directly measure the detector inefficiency corrections for the S1 signal from CH$_3$T data, since the maximum of the S1 spectrum falls below the detector threshold and there are no discernible features to fit to. Instead, we will continue working with the S2 signal of our data and return to the issue of S1 corrections in sections \ref{section:S1relation,MatthewsIdea,section:S1relation2}.


 
\subsection{Measuring Field Effects in $^{83m}$Kr S2 Data} \label{section:FieldEffects}

After measuring the S2 detector inefficiency corrections in CH$_3$T data we have all the tools we need to measure the field effects in the S2 pulse area of $^{83m}$Kr data.  We begin by applying the S2 detector inefficiency corrections to contemporaneous,  uncorrected $^{83m}$Kr data by using equation \ref{E_eq}.  The removal of the detector inefficiency effects from the raw S2 data leave us with an S2$_E$ signal which has spatial pulse area variation from field effects alone.

The process for measuring the field effects in the inefficiency corrected $^{83m}$Kr S2$_E$ data is similar to the process of measuring the detector inefficiency effects in the field effect corrected CH$_3$T S2$_F$ data.  First, we measure the field induced Z dependence of the $^{83m}$Kr S2$_E$ pulse area by slicing the detector into drift time bins of 10 $\mu$second width.  A Gaussian distribution is fit to the S2$_E$ spectrum of each bin to determine the mean S2$_E$ pulse area versus Z.   A cubic interpolation is used to determine the S2$_E$ Z dependence between each drift time bin, and a linear extrapolation based on the first and last 20\% of data points is used to determine the S2$_E$ Z dependence above and below the span of the drift time bins.  

We define the strength of the field effect in the z direction as the ratio of the S2$_E$ pulse area as a function of Z to the S2$_E$ pulse area at the center of the detector $z_c$, S2$_E$(z)/S2$_E$(center).  An S2 field effect correction for the Z direction, defined as $\eta_{(S2,Z)}$, is measured by taking the inverse of the strength of the field effect, 
\begin{equation}
\eta_{(S2,Z)} = \frac{S2_E(z=z_c)}{S2_E(z)}.
\end{equation} 

We also take a separate, three dimensional approach to mapping the field effect in the $^{83m}$Kr S2$_E$ data. In this approach the detector is divided into three dimensional voxels, with X and Y width of 3.5 cm and Z width of 30 $\mu$seconds.  As in the one dimensional case, a three dimensional map of the field induced S2$_E$ pulse area variation is produced by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the $^{83m}$Kr S2$_E$ data in each voxel.  A spline interpolation is used to determine the S2$_E$(xyz)/S2$_E$(center) ratio between the three dimensional voxels, and the S2$_E$(xyz)/S2$_E$(center) Z dependence map is used to extrapolate outside of the range of the voxels.  As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:S1aS1bField_S2}, the results are consistent between both measurements.
\subsection{Relating the S1a/S1b Ratio to S2 Field Effects} \label{section:S1aS1b2}

To relate the S1a/S1b ratio to the S2 field effects measured in section \ref{section:FieldEffects} we begin by measuring the spatial dependence of the S1a/S1b ratio.  We first divide the detector into drift time bins of 3 $\mu$second width.   A Gaussian distribution is fit to the S1a and S1b spectrum of each bin to determine the mean pulse areas versus Z.   A second order polynomial is fit to the ratio of the Gaussian means versus Z and is used to determine the S1a/S1b ratio at any drift time in the detector.  

As we did when measuring the strength of the field effect, we also take a separate, three dimensional approach to mapping the $^{83m}$Kr S1a/S1b ratio throughout the detector. In this approach the detector is divided into three dimensional voxels, with X and Y width of 3.5 cm and Z width of 30 $\mu$seconds.  A three dimensional map of S1a/S1b is produced by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the S1a and S1b pulse area spectrum in each voxel.  A spline interpolation and extrapolation is used to determine the S1a/S1b ratio between and outside of the three dimensional voxels.

We relate the Z dependence and three dimensional dependence maps of the S1a/S1b ratio to the Z dependence and three dimensional dependence maps of the S2 field effect measured in section \ref{section:FieldEffects}.  A second order polynomial is fit to the spatial dependence of the $^{83m}$Kr S2$_E$ (induced by the field effect) to S1a/S1b relationship, with best fit parameters of $a=-0.499 \pm 0.117$,$b=1.48 \pm 0.615$, and $c=0.667 \pm 0.946$ for the second order, first order, and zeroth order terms, respectively. This polynomial is used to determine the strength of the field effect in $^{83m}$Kr S2 data at all points in time.  We find that the Z dependence and three dimensional maps agree closely within the range of measured S1a/S1b ratios, but begin to diverge in the extrapolated regions (Figure \ref{fig:S1aS1bField_S2}). 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/Fig4.png}

\end{center}

\subsection{Measuring the S1a/S1b Ratio to S1 Field Effect Relationship with Recombination Physics} \label{section:S1relation}

We have successfully measured the strength of the field effect in $^{83m}$Kr S2 data at one point in time, and have related it to the $^{83m}$Kr S1a/S1b ratio such that we can determine the strength of the field effect at any point in time.  We are now left with the challenge of measuring the strength of the field effect in $^{83m}$Kr S1 data. Our first approach will turn to the recombination physics that governs particle interaction during a recoil event.  

The strength of the field effect (normalized to the detector center) in $^{83m}$Kr S2 data is given by the ratio of the inefficiency corrected S2$_E$ at a given position to the inefficiency corrected S2$_E$ at the center of the detector, which was measured in \ref{section:FieldEffects}.  This ratio can be written in terms of the recombination during a $^{83m}$Kr event ($R_{Kr}$) as follows
\begin{equation}
\frac{S2_{E,Kr}(xyz)}{S2_{E,Kr}(center)} = \frac{1-R_{Kr}(xyz)}{1-R_{Kr}(center)}
\end{equation}
Note that this can be rewritten as an expression for the recombination during a $^{83m}$Kr as a function of position,
\begin{equation} \label{RKr}
R_{Kr}(xyz) = 1- \frac{S2_{E,Kr}(xyz)}{S2_{E,Kr}(center)}(1-R_{Kr}(center)).
\end{equation}
Next, we write the strength of the field effect in $^{83m}$Kr S1 data (normalized to the detector center) as the ratio of the inefficiency corrected S1$_E$ signal at a given position to the inefficiency corrected S1$_E$ signal at the center of the detector, which we are unable to measure directly.  In terms of the exciton to ion ratio ($\alpha$) and the recombination during a $^{83m}$Kr event this is given by 
\begin{multline} \label{S1fieldstrength}
\frac{S1_{E,Kr}(xyz)}{S1_{E,Kr}(center)}=\frac{\alpha+R_{Kr}(xyz)}{\alpha+R_{Kr}(center)} \\ = \frac{\alpha + 1 - \frac{S2_{E,Kr}(xyz)}{S2_{E,Kr}(center)}(1-R_{Kr}(center))}{\alpha + R_{Kr}(center)}
\end{multline}
where we have used equation \ref{RKr} in the last step.  Therefore, all we need to measure the strength of the field effect in $^{83m}$Kr S1 data is the recombination during a $^{83m}$Kr event at the center of the detector, given by $R_{Kr}(center)$.  As mentioned in section \ref{section:GenStrat}, NEST does not simulate the physics of $^{83m}$Kr events well, but it has been tuned to simulate the physics of CH$_3$T events.  As such, we once again turn to the CH$_3$T data to determine the value of $R_{Kr}(center)$. 

First, we write the ratio of the efficiency corrected $^{83m}$Kr  S2$_E$ pulse area at the center of the detector to the efficiency corrected CH$_3$T S2$_E$ pulse are at the center of the detector in terms of the S2 gain factor ($g_2$), recombination during a $^{83m}$Kr event ($R_{Kr}$), recombination during a CH$_3$T event ($R_{H3}$), number of ions produced during a $^{83m}$Kr event ($N_{ion-Kr}$), and number of ions produced during a CH$_3$T event ($N_{ion-H3}$), given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{S2_{E,Kr}(center)}{S2_{E,H3}(center)} = \frac{g_2(1-R_{Kr}(center))N_{ion-Kr}}{g_2(1-R_{H3}(center))N_{ion-H3}}.
\end{equation}
This can be rewritten as an expression for the recombination of $^{83m}$Kr at the center of the detector given by
\begin{multline} \label{RKr_cent}
R_{Kr}(center)=1- \\ \frac{S2_{E,Kr}(center)}{S2_{E,H3}(center)}\frac{N_{ion-H3}}{N_{ion_Kr}}(1-R_{H3}(center))
\end{multline}
where the gain factor $g_2$ does not depend on energy, and therefore can be removed from the equation.  The number of ions for both $^{83m}$Kr events and CH$_3$T events is given by equations \ref{NqEq} and \ref{NionEq}, with the assumption $E=41.55$ keV for $^{83m}$Kr and $E=2.5$ keV for CH$_3$T, and the recombination at the center of the detector of CH$_3$T events ($R_{H3}$) can be determined from NEST.

Using equations \ref{S1fieldstrength} and \ref{RKr_cent} we can convert the field effect measured in the $^{83m}$Kr S2$_E$ data to an inferred field effect in $^{83m}$Kr S1 data.
The result of this is shown in Figure \ref{fig:S1FieldFig}.  It is possible that the complicated nature of the  $^{83m}$Kr decay introduces intricacies which are not account for in equations \ref{S1fieldstrength} and \ref{RKr_cent}.  In the next section we will seek to improve this result with a direct measurement of the S1a/S1b to S1 field effect relationship before turning to a $\chi^2$ minimization method in section \ref{section:S1relation2} to determine the optimal field effect to S1a/S1b relationships.

\subsection{Measuring the S1a/S1b Ratio to S1 Field Effect Relationship with the S1a Light Yield} \label{MatthewsIdea}

The relative light yield of the $^{83m}$Kr 32.1 keV decay, $^{83m}$Kr 9.4 keV decay, and $^{57}$Co 122 keV decay has been measured as a function of the light yield at an applied electric field divided by the light yield at zero electric field by Manalaysay, et al. in reference \cite{Manalaysay}.  We can combine NEST predictions for the light yield of the 122 keV $^{57}$Co line with the ratio of the light yield of the 32.1 keV $^{83m}$Kr line to the 122 keV $^{57}$Co line from reference \cite{Manalaysay} to convert the relative light yield measurements to absolute light yield measurements.  This results in an empirical formula for the absolute light yield of the $^{83m}$Kr 32.1 keV decay as a function of electric field given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{\gamma}{E} = 55.2[1-0.0004895 \times F \times \ln{(1 + 1/(8.9\mathrm{e}{-4} \times F))}]
\label{S1aYield}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the number of photons, $E$ is the energy of the decay, and $F$ is the applied electric field in units of V/cm.  

Using equation \ref{S1aYield} we can directly measure the strength of the field effect in the $^{83m}$Kr S1 data and relate it to the S1a/S1b ratio.  We begin by using the electric fields maps presented in reference~\cite{LuciesMaps} to estimate the electric field in the detector in September 2015.   The electric field map is converted to a map of the expected light yield at 32.1 keV using equation \ref{S1aYield}, assuming no detector inefficiency effects are present. The three dimensional spatial dependence of the light yield provides a direct measurement of the strength of the field effect in the S1a data, given by $\gamma(xyz)$/$\gamma(center)$.  Note that the strength of the field effect in the S1a data can help us derive the strength of the field effect in the combined S1 data, but the two are not equivalent.  Normalizing the field effect in the S1a data to the center of the detector, as shown in equation \ref{S1aNorm}, produces S1a$_F$ data which has spatial variation due to detector inefficiency effects only.  
\begin{equation}
S1a_F = S1a \frac{\gamma(center)}{\gamma(xyz)}
\label{S1aNorm}
\end{equation}
We measure the detector inefficiency effects in the S1a$_F$ data by dividing the detector into three dimensional voxels with X and Y width of 7 cm and Z width of 47 $\mu$Sec.  A Gaussian distribution is fit to the S1a$_F$ spectrum in each voxel, and the Gaussian mean is used to determine the spatial dependence of the S1a$_F$ data due to detector inefficiency effects alone.  Since the detector inefficiency effects are not dependent on the energy of an event, the spatial variation measured in the S1a$_F$ data is equivalent to the spatial variation in the combined S1 data due to detector inefficiency effects alone.  Therefore, we can use the spatial variation measured in the S1a$_F$ data to produce detector inefficiency corrected combined S1$_E$ data as shown in the equation
\begin{equation}
S1_E= S1 \frac{S1a_F(center)}{S1a_F(xyz)}.
\end{equation}
Any residual spatial variation in the detector inefficiency corrected combined S1$_E$ data is due to field effects in the combined $^{83m}$Kr S1 data alone.  We measure the strength of these field effects by again dividing the detector into three dimensional voxels with X and Y width of 7 cm and Z width of 47 $\mu$Sec.  A Gaussian distribution is fit to the S1$_E$ spectrum in each voxel, and the Gaussian mean is used to determine the spatial dependence of the S1a$_E$ data due to field effects alone.  At the same time, we use separate Gaussian distribution fits to the S1a and S1b data in each voxel to measure the spatial dependence of the S1a/S1b ratio.  Finally, we relate the S1a$_E$ Gaussian mean to the S1a/S1b ratio of each voxel and fit a second order polynomial which describes the strength of the field effect in the $^{83m}$Kr combined S1 signal to the data. (Figure \ref{S1aFieldEffect}) Note that the large systematic errors in the S1a/S1b ratio to field effect relationship is introduced by uncertainties in the field maps and systematic errors in the detector inefficiency corrections.  These errors a significantly reduced when extracting efficiency corrections from CH$_3$T data due to the lower energy, and therefore lower sensitivity to field effects.

\subsection{Measuring the S1a/S1b Ratio to S1 Field Effect Relationship with a $\chi^2$ Fitting Method} \label{section:S1relation2}

Although field induced variation in the recombination of a $^{83m}$Kr event can introduce a spatial and time dependence in the $^{83m}$Kr S1 and S2 signals, the total energy signal given (with gain factors $g_1$ and $g_2$) by 
\begin{equation} \label{CombinedEnergy}
E=\left(\frac{1}{73}\right)\left(\frac{S1_E}{g_1} + \frac{S2_E}{g_2}\right)
\end{equation}
should be insensitive to field variations.  We can take advantage of this fact to determine the optimal S1a/S1b to S1 field effect relationship corresponding to the directly measured S1a/S1b to S2 field effect relationship measured in section \ref{section:S1aS1b2}.  Unfortunately, we do not have knowledge of the strength of the field effect in the $^{83m}$Kr S1 signal, so we can not remove the field effect from the data to produce the efficiency-only corrected S1$_E$ signal.  Likewise, without efficiency corrected data we can not measure the gain factors $g_1$ and $g_2$ to produce a combined energy spectrum.  The only tools that we have at our disposal are a measurement of the strength of the field effect in the $^{83m}$Kr S2 signal and its relationship to S1a/S1b, as well as the ability to produce efficiency only corrected $^{83m}$Kr S2$_E$ data based on to the spatial variation of field effect corrected  $^{83m}$Kr S2$_F$ data.  In this section we turn to a $\chi^2$ minimization approach which will float the S1 field effect to S1a/S1b relationship, produce inefficiency corrections based on the field removed S1$_F$ and S2$_F$ signals, and then float the gain factors $g_1$ and $g_2$ to produce an optimized combined energy spectrum.  

We begin by eliminating one of the three parameters associated with the second order polynomial which describes the S1 field effect to S1a/S1b relationship.  We choose to normalize the spatial variation induced by the nonuniform electric field to the center of the detector, so the strength of the field effect as measured by $\frac{S1_{E,Kr}(xyz)}{S1_{E,Kr}(center)}$ must equal one at the center of the detector.  Therefore, we can relate one of the coefficients ($a$,$b$, and $c$) in the second order polynomial
\begin{equation}
 \frac{S1_{E,Kr}(xyz)}{S1_{E,Kr}(center)} = a\left(\frac{S1a}{S1b}\right)^2 + b\left(\frac{S1a}{S1b} \right) + c
 \end{equation}
 to the other two, such that
 \begin{equation}
 c=1-a\left(\frac{S1a_c}{S1b_c}\right)^2-b\left(\frac{S1a_c}{S1b_c}\right)
 \end{equation}
 where $S1a_c$ and $S1b_c$ represent the values of $S1a$ and $S1b$ at the center of the detector.  Next, we scan over a range of $a$ and $b$ values and produce the $\frac{S1_{E,Kr}(xyz)}{S1_{E,Kr}(center)}$ to $\frac{S1a}{S1b}$ relationship for each pair of $a$ and $b$ values.  We follow the procedure described in section \ref{KrypCalCode} and use the S1 field effect to S1a/S1b relationship from each pair of $a$ and $b$ values, in conjunction with the S2 field effect S1a/S1b relationship measured in \ref{section:FieldEffects}, to produce efficiency-only corrections for CH$_3$T data and $^{83m}$Kr data from September 2015 and February 2016. These corrections are used to produce S2$_E$ and S1$_E$ data for all four data sets.  We then scan over a range of $g_1$ and extraction efficiency (EE) values and use the S2$_E$ and S1$_E$ data to produce a combined energy spectrum (for each source) for each combination of $a$,$b$,$g_1$, and EE based on equation \ref{CombinedEnergy}.  Note that $g_2=SE \times EE$, where $SE$ is the single electron size at the time of each data set.  

To evaluate the performance of each $a$,$b$,$g_1$, and $EE$ combination we must develop models for the expected energy spectra of CH$_3$T and $^{83m}$Kr data in September 2015 and February 2016.  The $^{83m}$Kr events consist of a mono-energetic 32.1 keV decay and a mono-energetic 9.4 keV decay.  The expected energy spectrum is a Gaussian distribution centered around the sum of these two mono-energetic decays at 41.55 keV.  The width of the Gaussian distribution depends on a number of factors, including the detector's efficiency for collecting S1 and S2 light, as well as the spatial dependence of the recombination of $^{83m}$Kr events induced by the nonuniform electric field.  While we can measure most of these parameters, we would have to feed them into NEST to determine the final width of the Gaussian distribution.  Since NEST does not simulate $^{83m}$Kr events well, we can only use the mean of the Gaussian distribution as a figure of merit for the $^{83m}$Kr energy spectrum.

Tritium is a beta decay with an energy spectrum that has a broad peak at 2.5 keV and a smoothly falling distribution out to 18 keV.  As with $^{83m}$Kr, this spectrum is smeared based on a number of parameters.  Unlike $^{83m}$Kr, the smearing in CH$_3$T data can be accurately determined by NEST so we can compare the energy spectrum from data to simulations on a bin by bin basis. 

For each $a$,$b$,$g_1$, and $EE$ combination a reduced $\chi^2$ for the CH$_3$T and $^{83m}$Kr data is measured using the difference between the expected energy spectra and measured energy spectra.   During the $^{83m}$Kr $\chi^2$ calculation, the energy spectrum is from each point in time is divided into drift time bins so that the spatial dependence of the energy spectrum is included in the $\chi^2$ measurement.  The $^{83m}$Kr data has very high statistics, and only the mean of a Gaussian fit to the data is of interest, so the variance used in the $\chi^2$  measurement  is dominated by systematic error.  We use the standard deviation of the $^{83m}$Kr energy spectrum over the duration of Run03 to evaluate the size of this systematic error, and find $\sigma = 0.2395$.  During the CH$_3$T $\chi^2$  calculation, the energy spectrum is divided into energy bins so that the entire beta spectrum (above 3.5 keV to avoid the detector threshold) is included in the $\chi^2$ measurement.  The variance of the CH$_3$T data is based on statistics alone, due to finer binning and lower statistics of the data.  We choose to define a total reduced $\chi^2$ (to be minimized in the $\chi^2$ fit) as the average of the reduced $\chi^2$ for the $^{83m}$Kr and CH$_3$T data, so that each source carries the same amount of weight in the fit. A minimum average reduced  $\chi^2$ of 0.8413 is found for the best fit parameters of $a=0.065 \pm 0.0117$,$b=0.020 \pm 0.060$,$g_1=0.0980 \pm 0.001$, and $EE=0.808 \pm 0.029$. The corresponding value of the zeroth order coefficient is $c=0.461 \pm 0.186$.  The reduced $\chi^2$ of the $^{83m}$Kr and CH$_3$T energy spectra separately are 12.17/26=0.4682 (p=0.99) and 150.6/124=1.2143 (p=0.05), respectively. Note that (as we will see in section \ref{Results}) the extraction efficiency needed to produce these results is consistent with our expectations, and the results produce $^{83m}$Kr energy peaks (unbinned in drift time) that are within one sigma of the expected 41.55 keV in both September 2015 and February 2016. 


\subsection{Summary of S1a/S1b Ratio to Field Effect Measurements}

We have directly measured the strength of the field effect in $^{83m}$Kr S2 data by removing detector inefficiency effects from the data with the help of CH$_3$T data.  We have also used a $\chi^2$ optimization methods to find the optimal S1 field effect to S1a/S1b relationship to pair with the direct S2 field effect measurement.  We find that the optimal S1 field effect found by a $\chi^2$ optimization agrees very closely with our expectations from recombination physics, and from the expected light yield of the $^{83m}$Kr S1 data 32.1 keV decay.   We choose to use the S2 field relationship measured in section \ref{section:S1aS1b2} and the corresponding optimal S1 field effect relationship measured in section \ref{section:S1relation2} for our work.  The polynomials that describe these relationships are:
\begin{multline}
\frac{S2_{E,Kr}(xyz)}{S2_{E,Kr}(center)} =   \\ -0.499 \left(\frac{S1a}{S1b} \right)^2 + 1.48  \left(\frac{S1a}{S1b} \right) + 0.667
\end{multline}
\begin{multline}
\frac{S1_{E,Kr}(xyz)}{S1_{E,Kr}(center)} = \\  0.065 \left(\frac{S1a}{S1b} \right)^2 + 0.020 \left(\frac{S1a}{S1b} \right) + 0.461
\end{multline}
