We discuss signal variations introduced by LUX's nonuniform drift field and present multiple methods to measure and separate these effects from standard detector inefficiency effects in the data.  A measurement of the strength of the field effects in $^{83m}$Kr calibration data is presented, and the results of the signal corrections used in LUX's WS2014-16 data are evaluated.
